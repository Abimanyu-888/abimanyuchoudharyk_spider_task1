# Spider_task_1
## üß† Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Spider R&D Software Task 1 (Inductions '25)**. 

The task is divided into two main sections:
- **Common Tasks**: Choose and complete any three from various domains.
- **Domain-Specific Task**: One specialized task, based on the selected interest area.
